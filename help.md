I'm the /r/Wellington meetup notification bot.

---

Here's my basic command syntax:

- To subscribe to all meetup notifications, please send "!subscribe /r/Wellington"
- To subscribe to meetup notifications based on a search string, please send !subscribe /r/Wellington <SEARCH STRING>, for example "!subscribe /r/Wellington picnic"
- To unsubscribe, simply send the word "unsubscribe"
